Integrate a new section called “Game Zone” into my existing website (Node.js + Express). This section should be fully connected to the central Wallet and user system. The Game Zone will offer interactive mini-games that reward users with bonuses, credits, or USDT. Requirements:

1. **Navigation & Entry Animation**:
   - Add a “Game Zone” button to the main navigation bar.
   - On click, trigger a short, energetic animation (e.g., coins falling, jackpot flash).
   - After animation, load the Game Zone dashboard.

2. **Available Games**:
   - Include 2–3 simple, addictive games:
     - 🎡 Spin Wheel: Random bonus (0–100 USDT).
     - 🎯 Scratch Card: Reveal hidden prize.
     - 🔢 Number Match: Pick 3 numbers; match to win.
   - just make it as example, no logic/game need inside. i will tell you later about the game name,logic,UI,etc details.

3. **Reward System**:
   - All winnings go to the user’s Wallet (bonus balance).
   - Show animated success messages when a user wins.
   - Log every play and outcome in a `game_history` table.

4. **Game Zone Dashboard**:
   - Display available games with play buttons and cooldown indicators.
   - Show user’s current bonus balance.
   - Include a “Recent Wins” section and game history.

5. **Backend Logic**:
   - Use secure, fair randomization (seeded PRNG).
   - Enforce cooldowns and prevent abuse.
   - Validate user session before allowing gameplay.

6. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Use vibrant, playful colors (gold, green, blue).
   - Mobile-first design with fast loading.
   - Optional sound effects with toggle switch.

7. **Admin Panel Integration**:
   - Admin can view game logs, user win stats, and manually credit bonuses.

8. **Security & Abuse Prevention**:
   - Strict cooldown enforcement.
   - Log IP/device info per play (optional).
   - Prevent multiple sessions or bots from exploiting games.

Ensure the Game Zone feels fun, rewarding, and seamlessly integrated into the existing platform. Keep the code modular, scalable, and optimized for performance.
