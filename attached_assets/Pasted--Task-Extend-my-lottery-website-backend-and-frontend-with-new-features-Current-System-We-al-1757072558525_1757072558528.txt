> Task: Extend my lottery website backend and frontend with new features.


Current System: We already have Daily, Weekly, and Monthly lucky draws with prize pool distribution logic (1:2 split, fees, optional rewards, free monthly tickets, etc.). Keep that logic as it is.

New Requirements:


---

1. Surprise Draw (New Section)

Add a separate section on the frontend named "Surprise Draw".

Default message to display:

> "Surprise draw is not available at this moment, keep an eye as it can appear at any time with exciting Surprise rewards."



This draw is manually created by admin. Admin can set:

Prize pool

Number of winners

Reward type (cash, gift, custom text)

Winning logic (random fair shuffle of all tickets)


When an active surprise draw exists, replace default text with live draw details (timer, pool, ticket price, etc.).

Once draw ends, show results and reset back to default message.

2. Mystery Search Game (Game Zone)

Registration System:

Cost: $1 per user to register before game starts.

Only registered users can participate.

Others can only watch progress but cannot submit guesses.


Game Rules:

Each round runs for 3 days.

At start of each round:

System generates a random 12-word wallet seed phrase.

Show 1st and 10th word as clues immediately.

Show a text box for registered users to submit full seed phrase.

Each wrong submission triggers 1 minute cooldown before next try.


Clue Reveal Logic:

After 24h → reveal 4th word + message "more clues coming soon".

Every 4h after that, reveal another word in this order: 12th → 7th → 3rd → 9th → 11th → 2nd → 8th → 5th → 6th.


Winning Condition:

When someone submits correct phrase → game instantly ends.

Show winner username + reveal full seed phrase to everyone.

Winner receives prize money after round ends.


No Winner Case:

Game silently ends after 3 days.

Show full seed phrase publicly and mark "no winner this round".


After round ends → immediately start a new round.


UI Behavior:

Show progress of clue reveal to everyone.

Only registered users see submission box.

Show a small box saying:

> "Missed the current game? Register for the next game before it starts!"
whenever a game is running.

3. Try Your Luck Game (Game Zone)

Free to play game, but requires $1 lock from user’s balance.

Two options when locking money:

1. Standard: Lock for 3 days (auto-unlock after game ends).


2. Lock Until Win:

Money stays locked across multiple rounds until user manually requests unlock.

Unlock request only takes effect after the current round ends.




After game ends:

If user did not win → show message:

> "Not win this time. Better luck next time!"



Unlock or keep locked money depending on user choice.

4. General Requirements

Ensure fair randomization when selecting winners.

Maintain memory efficiency (delete temporary data after draw/game ends).

Provide secure backend endpoints for:

Creating / updating surprise draws (admin only)

Registering for Mystery Search

Submitting seed phrase guess

Locking/unlocking funds for Try Your Luck

Fetching game states (for frontend updates)


Provide example JSON request/response for each endpoint for easy integration.

---

Deliverables from AI:

Backend implementation (controllers, models, routes).

Example API endpoints for all new features.

Frontend placeholder components (Surprise Draw box, Mystery Search UI, Try Your Luck UI).

Timer logic & clue reveal scheduling.

Proper state reset after each draw/game round.

Secure admin panel endpoints for manual surprise draw creation.
